# pipline demo --> ESP8266-bynk-phonk.app
A simple way for prototyping physical interaciotns with Micro-controllers (ESP8266) and mobile phones (android phones running phonk.app). 

This Repository contains an Basic introduction on how to use NodeMCUs (ESP8266) (programmed using the Arduino IDE) and connecting them to the IOT plattform blynk.io. And further more on how to use webhooks in blynk to enable an interacitons between the ESP8266 and phonk.app running on an Android phone.

Addtionally you will find collection of simple examples to get stated.

This Repo is part of a workshop for the UltraTool - Project by the wei√üensee kunsthochschule Berlin (schon of art and design) and the Imperial Collage.


## preparation

* download blynk app from https://blynk.io to an mobile phone, open the app and create an account. 
* download the phonk.app to your android deivce https://phonk.app/
* Download the Arduino IDE https://www.arduino.cc/en/software 
* Add NodeMCU Hardware-Library to Arduino: https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/electropeak/getting-started-w-nodemcu-esp8266-on-arduino-ide-28184f or here https://www.instructables.com/Steps-to-Setup-Arduino-IDE-for-NODEMCU-ESP8266-WiF/
* You might need to install the drive for the NodeMCU, as well: https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers
